## About

The [@timagebot](https://timagebot.t.me) is a inline Telegram bot that generates
a image with the provided text!

A custom syntax will be implemented later to allow to config color, font and
text position.

This bot uploads the image in a custom group/channel and reuses the cached photo!

## Usage

Very simple, just call the bot in any chat

```text
@timagebot Hello World!.
```

Note the ending dot (`.`) in text content, it will be removed from image, but
it shows to bot that the message is finished. If you want to place a ending dot,
just put two dots in end.
